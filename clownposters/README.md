# Merkle Proof Verifier

https://scatter-partners.github.io/merkle-proof/

This tool is primarially for verifying Merkle roots used by collection contracts published through https://www.scatter.art/

Use this tool to verify that Merkle roots are proper. Use the same list that was used to generate and you should get the same root.

You can also use this tool to verify that an address is contained within a Merkle root. For example, you can lookup Merkle roots for lists on a collection's Etherscan page and check to make sure your address is in that list.
